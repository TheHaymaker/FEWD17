# FEWD Week #2: Styling with CSS

---

### Description

A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, has approached you to help them develop a new landing page for their company. They've handed you the [design file](design_file.txt) for the site, along with the copy and assets. You need to take these files and turn it into a landing page.

_Note: For a view of the full page, see the [jpg](images/relaxr_landing.jpg) provided in the deliverable. Don't be alarmed if your font sizes don't perfectly match what you see in the jpg - trust in the design file!_

### Real-World Applications

- Build a website from a [design file](design_file.txt)
- Integrate advanced CSS properties
- Use HTML5 structural elements
- Use a CSS reset to "normalize" the rendering of your page across different browsers
- Use the Box Model to style element borders and structure your page

---

### Technical Requirements

- Use a CSS Reset file in addition to your style.css file to style the page
- Use IDs and Classes to to select and style elements on the page
- Style your text with the Google Fonts provided by your style guide
- Follow naming conventions, maintain consistency across .html and .css files and use best practices for naming IDs and Classes
